							<h2>About Me<br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Being a young adult, I possess new and innovative ideas. I am very much dedicated and
						determined towards my work. I can adapt to the requirements of the organization. I am also an
						excellent coder. I want to work for an organization that provides me the opportunity to improve
						my skills and knowledge to grow along with the organization’s objective.
						</p>
						
						<p>A well-rounded undergraduate program in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam was a major breakthrough for me. This gave me the impetus to delve deeper into the world of Computer Science which rekindled the fire to explore the areas of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision to name a few. My aptitude for these subjects and analytical skills led to my consistent position in the top 5% of class. With time came Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, OpenCV each varied in its appeal yet lending a generality of setting to Artificial Intelligence in its own way. It was the deep interest that I had for Artificial Intelligence that made me pursue projects and Hackathons which were based on its practical applications.

						<h2>Current Interest</h2>
						<p> Automatic Summarization using Natural Language Processing - 
						Going back to the amount of text data we face every day, information overload could be a real drawback but now we have Automatic Summarization. This is the process of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. The most important advantage of using a summary is it reduces the reading time.</p>
						
						<p>Convolutional features for Visual Recognition - Build and analyse convolutional architectures tailored for a number of conventional problems in vision: image categorisation, fine-grained recognition, content-based retrieval, and various aspect of face recognition. On the practical side, you’ll learn how to build your own key-points detector using a deep regression CNN.
						</p>
						
						<p> Interactive Machine Learning - This challenge can be overcome by involving humans in the machine learning process. By incorporating human feedback in the model training process, it can be trained faster and more efficiently to give more accurate predictions.
						</p>
